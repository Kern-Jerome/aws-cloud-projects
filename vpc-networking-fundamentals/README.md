# Project: VPC Networking Fundamentals
## Overview

Designed and configured a basic Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to understand AWS networking fundamentals, including subnets, routing, and internet access.

## AWS Services Used

Amazon VPC

Internet Gateway

Route Tables

AWS Management Console

## What I Did

Created a custom VPC with a defined CIDR block

Configured public and private subnets

Attached an Internet Gateway to enable external access

Set up route tables to control traffic flow

Associated subnets with appropriate routing rules

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

Cloud networking vs on-prem networking

CIDR blocks and IP addressing

Public vs private subnets

Internet Gateways and routing

Network isolation and segmentation

## Outcome

Successfully deployed a functional VPC environment that supports internet-accessible and isolated resources.

## What I Learned

How AWS networking is structured at a foundational level

Why subnet design impacts security and scalability

How routing controls resource accessibility
